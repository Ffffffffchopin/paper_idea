##      The people with the opinion that we should stop the development argues that developments bring us more negative influence than positive. Greenhouse effect, species extinction, and some society problems like unemployment caused by technological revolution that was not exist before long. They think that we human can lives fully with existing technology but more technology only obtin more from earth.With the effect and money contributed to the technology,we should have improve hundreds of hungry people.








##     But more be oppose to these views.Realistically speaking,Technology does bring us more comfortable lives. Please imagine traveling back five hundred years ago,even the emperor unable to have the living conditions we have now.Technology  enrich our material lives out of power,positions, So It's selfless.Two hundred years ago,When people see the train for the first time,they laugh at train being slower than hourse; one hundred years ago,when they see the plane fly in the sky,they says that they will never baord that danguore monster .

##    I recall the great speech President Kennedy given on 1969,
> "Why we choose to go to moon,the people who ask this question will also
> ask'Why we should climb the mountain',that't because mountain is here." 
##      Back to the moment that Internet was created,several scientists in Europe Atomic Energy Laboratory invent it to fight boredom.We human never stop explore the world.
